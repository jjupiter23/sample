What the code is able to accomplish is explained below:

* Plots restaurants across Cebu City - for demonstration purposes search radius is limited to 500
* Restaurant can be filtered according to cuisine offered, currently the only options available are Filipino, Chinese, American and Mexican.
* Directions to the establishment can be triggered by clicking the designated marker
* Usage of drawing tools to count the number of restaurants within the bounds of a user drawn circle or rectangle. In order for this to function, the user must first filter restaurants to enable the map markers. Then by drawing a shape it will count how many restaurants are in the vicinity.
