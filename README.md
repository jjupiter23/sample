# A sample exercise using the Google Maps API, code is still incomplete but able to demonstrate basic usage of Maps Javascript API.

What the code is able to accomplish is explained below:

* Basic usage of Marker class and Event Handlers

* Drawing Library - limited to drawing Circles and Rectangle polygons, also limited to only 1 instance of the object with the option of deleting the selected shape on the map.

* Places API - usage of the 'Nearby Search requests' function in order to mark nearby restaurants from the given starting point of Cebu City

* Detection of a restaurant within the bounds of the user drawn polygon, just one for demonstration purposes (try drawing a circle or rectangle in the Jollibee Marker, a simple Javascript prompt would return True)

That's it! More to come :P
